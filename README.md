# Node_Js
 
Project Overview:

This Node.js project is a comprehensive backend system designed to manage and deliver content through a series of RESTful APIs. It involves multiple functionalities including user management, content delivery, and file handling, all secured through JWT authentication. The project uses MongoDB for data storage and includes essential middleware for processing and validation.

Key Features:

Content Management:

/api/courses: Provides endpoints for managing course-related data. Users can retrieve, create, update, and delete courses.
User Management:

/api/user: Handles user-related operations, including registration, login, and profile management. This API ensures user data is properly managed and secured.
File Handling:

/uploads: Manages file uploads, allowing users to upload and access files related to courses or user profiles.
Authentication:

JWT Authentication: Secures API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Ensures that only authenticated users can access or modify resources.
Middleware:

Includes various middleware functions to handle tasks such as logging, authentication checks, and request validation.
Database:

MongoDB: Used for storing user data, course information, and any other content. Provides a flexible and scalable database solution for the project.
Technologies Used:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
Express: Web framework for Node.js to build RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage.
JWT: JSON Web Tokens for authentication and authorization.
Multer (or similar): Middleware for handling file uploads.
Project Goals:

Provide a robust and secure API for managing educational content.
Ensure a seamless user experience through efficient data management and authentication.
Implement scalable solutions to handle growing data and user load.
